	<p style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;font-family: bradley hand,cursive;text-align: center;" > Oh, Lord, this is not a stone.
	<br> It smells so much of milk.
	<br>And the flame of hope fluttered in my soul,
	<br>And a lump arose in my throat.
	<br>This is why women risked their children!
	<br>They protected us from illness,
	<br>They saved us from unbelief.
	<br>They understood that we were not enemies,
	<br>But just unfortunate women.
	<br>And they helped as much as they could,
	<br>Amazed us with their humanity.
	<br>I silently crawled across the ice,
	<br>Collecting precious stones.
	<br>And at night in the coldest barracks,
	<br>On the ground desecrated by executioners,
	<br>I, a German, prayed to the Muslim God,
	<br>But I did not ask for anything for myself.
	<br>I asked for health for the old people,
	<br>For women-mothers - happiness.</p>
